# Downshift Hooks

Every React hook offers custom logic to build the kind of dropdown you need. If
you need to build a **combobox** then use [useCombobox](/use-combobox).

However, if you don't need to type a search query and just have a dropdown that
is actioned by a button (a **select**, basically), then use
[useSelect](/use-select).

If you need to add multiple selection for any of them and have the selected
items act as a Tag List next to the _select_ or _combobox_, then
[useMultipleSelection](/use-multiple-selection) is the right tool for that.
