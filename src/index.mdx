Primitives to build simple, flexible, WAI-ARIA compliant React
autocomplete/combobox or select dropdown components.

## The problem

You need an autocomplete/combobox or select experience in your application and
you want it to be accessible. You also want it to be simple and flexible to
account for your use cases.

You need an autocomplete/combobox or a select experience in your application and
you want it to be accessible. You also want it to be simple and flexible to
account for your use cases. Finally, it should follow the ARIA design pattern
for a [combobox][combobox-aria] or a [select][select-aria], depending on your
use case.

## This solution

The library offers a couple of solutions. The first solution, which is the one
we recommend you to try first, is a set of React hooks. Each hook provides the
stateful logic needed to make the corresponding component functional and
accessible. Navigate to the documentation for each by using the links in the
list below.

- [useSelect](/use-select) for a custom select component.
- [useCombobox](/use-combobox) for a combobox/autocomplete input.
- [useMultipleSelection](/use-multiple-selection) for selecting multiple items
  in a select or a combobox, as well as deleting items from selection or
  navigating between the selected items.

The second solution is the [Downshift](/downshift) component, which can also be used to
create accessible combobox and select components, providing the logic in the
form of a render prop. It served as inspiration for developing the hooks and it
has been around for a while. It established a successful pattern for making
components accessible and functional while giving developers complete freedom
when building the UI.
